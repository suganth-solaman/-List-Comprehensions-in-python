# -List-Comprehensions-in-python
Let's learn about list comprehensions! You are given three integers x,y and z representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an integer n . Print a list of all possible coordinates given by (i,j,k) on a 3D grid where the sum of i+j+k is not equal to n . Here, 0&lt;=i&lt;=x:0&lt;=j&lt;=y:0&lt;=k&lt;=z. Please use list comprehensions rather than multiple loops, as a learning exercise.
